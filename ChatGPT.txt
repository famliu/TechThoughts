Everybody talks about ChatGPT, I needs to find an analogy to explain for my son...

ChatGPT is just like....... a politician!

It knows a lot of things/problems.
It is taught to tell/answer them.
It can talk a lot without saying anything.
It can lie.
It has common sense but is not expert on anything.
It is good at talking but less impressive at math/logic
There are (will be) many of them
Some politicians are already threat for humanity. ChatGPT is still junior and innocent so there is hope. How will it develop? Nobody knows. I personally believe some kind of regulation is needed.
Human stupidity is probably greater threat to humanity than AI "intelligence".
...

Now I just hope he has learned enough from social science class so he understands:-)
